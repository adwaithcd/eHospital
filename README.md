# eHospital
eHospital is a Hospital Patient Management System. The system will be used to get information from the patients and storing the data for future use. Doctors will also use the system to keep track of the patients assigned to them. The current system in use is a paper-based system. It is too slow and cannot provide updated lists of patients within a reasonable timeframe. Doctors must make rounds to pick up patientsâ€™ treatment cards in order to know whether they have cases to treat or not. The intentions of the system are to reduce over-time pay and increase the number of patients that can be treated accurately.
